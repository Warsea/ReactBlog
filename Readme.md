# ReactBlog
This is a blog that contains information about different products. This is built using React(with hooks) on the front-end, which consumes data from a server that serves fake data. The front-end is mobile first responsive and uses different libraries like react router, axios, react-spring and the css utility framework tailwindcss. The back-end uses casualjs to generate fake data, which is served by an expressjs api.
In order to run the app:
1) Clone the repository.
2) open 2 separate terminals in the 'server'and the 'client' directory and run the 'npm install' command.
3) After the packages are installed, run 'npm start' on 2 seperate terminals.
